Create a technical diagram illustrating the architecture and data flow of the "Connect to Connect" real-time media synchronization application.

**Visual Style:**
- Clean, modern, high-contrast schematic or flowchart.
- Use distinct colors for Client (e.g., Blue/Green) and Server (e.g., Orange/Purple) components.
- Use arrows to show data flow direction.

**Key Components to Include:**

1.  **Client A (Host/User)**:
    - Represented as a browser window or device.
    - Contains: "Next.js Frontend", "Video Player Component", "Socket.io Client".
    - Action: Shows an arrow labeled "Click Play/Seek" originating here.

2.  **Client B (Viewer/Peer)**:
    - Represented as a second browser window or device.
    - Contains: "Next.js Frontend", "Video Player Component", "Socket.io Client".
    - Action: Shows the video player updating (e.g., "Syncs to 1:30").

3.  **Server (Backend)**:
    - Central node represented as a server icon or cloud.
    - Contains: "Node.js + Express", "Socket.io Server", "Room Manager (In-Memory)".
    - Function: Handles "Events" and "Broadcasting".

**Data Flow (The "What Happens" Loop):**
1.  **Event Emission**: Draw an arrow from **Client A** to **Server** labeled: `emit('play', {time: 10s})` or `emit('seek', {time: 90s})`.
2.  **Processing**: Inside the **Server**, show a small process labeled "Broadcast to Room".
3.  **Event Reception**: Draw an arrow from **Server** to **Client B** labeled: `on('receive_play', {time: 10s})`.

**Annotations/Labels:**
- Add a legend or side note explaining:
    - **WebSockets**: "Persistent, bidirectional connection for real-time low-latency updates."
    - **Room Logic**: "Users are grouped by Room ID (e.g., 'room-1234') so actions only affect peers in the same room."
    - **Sync Algorithm**: "Leader sends state -> Server relays -> Followers apply state."

**Layout:**
- Left side: Client A
- Center: Server
- Right side: Client B
- Arrows connecting them in a triangular or hub-and-spoke pattern.
